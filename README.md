## Installation
1. Install one or more of the following depending on what kind of wallpapers and desktop environment/window manager you are using:
    - `hyprpaper` if using `hyprland` and using only `png`, `jpeg`, `webp` or `jxl` images.
    - `swaybg` if using `sway` and only using `png`, `jpeg`, `tiff`, `tga` or `gif` images.
    - `mpvpaper` if using any kind of video or image format, but requires command line arguments to be passed to `mpv` for additional configuration.
    - `swww` for displaying `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `pnm`, `tga`, `tiff`, `webp`, `bmp` or `farbfeld` images and want transitions between images.
2. Install `waytrogen` using:
    - If on Arch Linux, `waytrogen` is on the [`AUR`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/waytrogen)
    - If on NixOS, `waytrogen` is on the [`NUR`](https://github:nikolaizombie1/nur-packages)

## Dependencies
- `hyprpaper`, `swaybg`, `mpvpaper` or `swww`
- `ffmpeg`

## Usage
The `waytrogen` command can be used the terminal to launch the application or be launched using an application launcher.

The `waytrogen --restore` or `waytrogen -r` command can be used to restore previously set wallpapers.

The `waytrogen --list` or `waytrogen -l` command prints, to standard output, the current state of wallpaper changers in JSON format 

The `waytrogen --external_script` or `waytrogen -e` command passes an external executable script to `waytrogen`. It executes after a wallpaper has changed and is passed the following arguments:
1. The `monitor` that the wallpaper was set to.
2. The `path` of the wallpaper.
3. The `complete state` of the currently set wallpapers.
